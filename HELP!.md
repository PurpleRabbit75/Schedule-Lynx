# Instructions for Non-Technical People

1. Click [here](https://github.com/PurpleRabbit75/Schedule-Lynx/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). A file will download.

2. Next, *unzip* the file. Here is how to do it:

    - On Windows, open File Explorer and go to `Downloads`. Double-click on the file named `Schedule-Lynx.zip`. When it opens, click the `Extract All` button in the top menu, and then click OK. The unzipped folder is now in `Downloads`.
    
    - On Mac, open Finder and go to `Downloads`. Double-click `Schedule-Lynx.zip`. The unzipped folder is now in `Downloads`.

    -On Ubuntu Linux (or similar), open terminal and run the following command:
     ```
    unzip ~/Downloads/Schedule-Lynx.zip
    ```
    If this returns an error, run
    ```
    sudo apt-get install unzip
    ```
    and try again. 

3. Next, open the folder and run the app.

    - On Windows, double-click on `run-main-dot-py.exe`
    - On Linux, open Terminal and run the following:
    ```
    cd ~/Downloads/Schedule-Lynx
    ./run-main-dot-py.sh
    ```
